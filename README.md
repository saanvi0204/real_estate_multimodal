# Multimodal Real Estate Price Prediction using Satellite Imagery

This project develops a **multimodal regression pipeline** to predict residential property prices by combining **tabular housing attributes** with **satellite imagery**.  
The approach integrates environmental context—such as green cover, road density, and proximity to water—into traditional real estate valuation models.

The project follows a **research-oriented workflow**, progressing from exploratory analysis to multimodal modeling, explainability, and final inference.

---

## Project Highlights

- Combines **tabular data + satellite images** for price prediction  
- Uses **residual learning** to let images correct tabular model errors  
- Evaluates multiple **multimodal fusion strategies**  
- Provides **model explainability** via Grad-CAM  
- Produces a final **prediction CSV** for unseen test data

## Setup Instructions

### Create Environment

Using **Anaconda** (recommended):

```bash
conda create -n real_estate_mm python=3.10
conda activate real_estate_mm
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

### API Key Configuration (Satellite Images)

Satellite images are fetched programmatically using a map API (e.g., Google Maps Static API).

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. The key is automatically read inside `src/data_fetcher.py`.

**Do not commit `.env` to GitHub** (already ignored via `.gitignore`).

---

## Satellite Image Acquisition (`data_fetcher.py`)

The script `src/data_fetcher.py` is responsible for **programmatically downloading satellite images** for each property using its latitude and longitude.

### Purpose

* Augment tabular housing data with **visual environmental context**
* Capture features such as:

  * Green cover
  * Road density
  * Urban vs residential texture
  * Proximity to water bodies

### Functionality

`data_fetcher.py` performs the following steps:

1. **Reads property IDs and coordinates** (latitude, longitude) from the dataset
2. **Constructs API requests** to a satellite imagery service (e.g., Google Maps Static API)
3. **Downloads satellite images** at a fixed zoom level and resolution
4. **Saves images locally** using the convention:

```
data/images/<property_id>.0.png
```

5. **Implements safeguards**:

   * Skips images that already exist
   * Applies rate-limiting between API calls
   * Logs failed downloads without interrupting execution

### Why This Is a Separate Script

* Image fetching is **deterministic and reusable**
* Separating it from notebooks avoids:

  * Accidental API overuse
  * Mixing I/O-heavy code with modeling logic
* Keeps notebooks focused on **analysis and learning**

This script must be executed **before any image-based modeling steps**.

## 🔬 Reproducibility Notes

* All random seeds are fixed where applicable
* Pretrained ImageNet weights are used for CNN initialization
* Tabular scaler and models are saved and reused (no test leakage)
* Satellite image resolution and zoom are consistent across train and test
* Processed datasets and intermediate artifacts are generated during execution and not committed
* No retraining is performed during inference

---

## 📤 Final Output

The final deliverable is:

```
outputs/predictions.csv
```

Format:

```
id,predicted_price
```

This file contains predicted property prices for the unseen test dataset.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated using:

* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
* **R² Score**

Comparisons between tabular-only and multimodal models are reported in `model_training.ipynb`.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

This project demonstrates that **satellite imagery provides complementary environmental signals** that improve real estate valuation when integrated thoughtfully with tabular data—particularly via residual learning and explainable deep vision models.
